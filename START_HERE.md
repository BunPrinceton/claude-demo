## 🎯 The Core Strategy

### Phase 1: The Hook
Run the demo. Say: "This program was written by Claude in 30 seconds."

### Phase 2: The Experience
Let the demo run. Don't oversell. Watch his reactions.

### Phase 3: The Interaction
Open Claude. Let him ask it something.

### Phase 4: The Close
"It's been really useful. Worth trying if you're curious."

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Show, don't tell** - The demo does the convincing
2. **Be low pressure** - You're sharing something cool, not selling
3. **Have Claude open** - Live interaction is most convincing
4. **Know your use case** - Be ready to explain how YOU use it
5. **Expect skepticism** - It's normal and healthy
